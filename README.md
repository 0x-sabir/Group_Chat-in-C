# Group_Chat-in-C

This repository contains code for a multi-client chat application implemented in C using sockets and threads. The system consists of two parts:

Server: Manages multiple client connections and facilitates message broadcasting among connected clients.
Client: Connects to the server and allows the user to send and receive messages in real-time.

This project demonstrates a simple and efficient way to build a multi-client chat application using socket programming and threading in C. It serves as a foundational implementation for more advanced networking applications.

Feel free to explore and enhance the project! ðŸ˜Š
